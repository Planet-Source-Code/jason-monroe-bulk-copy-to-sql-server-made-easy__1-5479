## Bulk Copy to SQL Server Made Easy


</div>

### Description

BCP is a method to transfer large amounts of data from a flat file into SQL Server VERY quickly. BCP is a functionality of the low-level DBLib environment. Unfortunately the modern data components (ADO, DAO, RDO) don't support bulk copy. <br><br>

The only way to get to BCP in the past was to either use the BCP.exe tool shipped with SQL Server, or to write some serious low level BCP type stuff.

<br><br>

I wrote slpBCP.dll as a wrapper for VBSQL.ocx and DBLib. It will allow you the developer to reference the DLL in your project, Create a reference to the object, set a few properties, call a routine... and bulk copy data into your SQL server.
